I've figured out a way to do the Camera2D / RemoteTransform2D generically - so it will work for the player in any Level scene.
(Ben has probably already done this in future videos ??  I've only watched to this video so far)
(1). Add the Camera2D to the scene as shown in the video
(2). Add the RemoteTransform2D  to the player as shown in the video
(3). Add a script to the RemoteTransform2D and add this code:
func _ready():
	var main = get_tree().current_scene
	var camera2D = main.get_node("Camera2D")
	var fullPathName = "/root/" + main.name + "/" + camera2D.name
	#print(fullPathName)  # To check.  This will give you something like:  /root/Level_01/Camera2D, etc
	set_remote_node (fullPathName)
No doubt there's probably even easier ways to do this, and someone will be along shortly to point this out.  Anyway, hopefully this helps others out there.
