Just finished the entire video series - up to and including the Bonus video (23).  Special thanks to Ben for doing such a stellar job and producing such engaging videos.  Working through these was like reading Lord of the Rings for the first time ... once I started I just could not stop.   It was so much fun !  I'm an old programmer with over 4 decades of experience, and programming is my "happy place" !  Thank you Ben !  Am planning to continue on and do your 1-But course in the near future.  Got to strike while the iron is hot. !   I clicked +1 LIKE for every video.   One final thing that may help others .... where I've found issues / traps that caught me, I've added comments below the video to explain what happened and how to fix.  And I've uploaded ZIP / 7z files of the project every 3 videos or so to my Github and uploaded as ZIP / 7z files, and my final files are there as well ... so if anyone is stuck, cannot proceed past a certain video, cannot fix an error, then maybe my code might help get you going again:

09:14: "I haven't ever contributed to Godot before."
Not true.  You have convinced me to give Godot another look ... after giving it a darn good try, hitting bugs and issues, and virtually giving up on it 12+ months ago.  And I'm liking the new Godot a lot better this time round - all thanks to you !  ??  +1 LIKE on all your videos, and +1 SUBSCRIBE.

28:10: Recommend you make GrassEffect an onready var at class level so that the scene is not loaded from file every time.
onready var GrassEffect = load("res://Scenes/GrassEffect.tscn")

Make sure you write "attack" in lower case in the Grass.dg script or the grass will NOT dissappear when you attack:
func _process(delta):
	if Input.is_action_just_pressed("attack"):
		queue_free()

02:00: got to here ... and my Fox now runs off the bottom of the screen whenever I press Roll when facing down ...  been through the code ... back through videos and back through my code and I cannot see how or why this is happening.  Added print statements to my code ...  will report back when I find the issue, it might help someone else track down any issues they may have.

Found the issue: in the player AnimationTree, in the Roll node, the top of the triangle was "Run Down" instead of "Roll Down".  Fixed this and all works OK.

I've figured out a way to do the Camera2D / RemoteTransform2D generically - so it will work for the player in any Level scene.
(Ben has probably already done this in future videos ??  I've only watched to this video so far)
(1). Add the Camera2D to the scene as shown in the video
(2). Add the RemoteTransform2D  to the player as shown in the video
(3). Add a script to the RemoteTransform2D and add this code:
func _ready():
	var main = get_tree().current_scene
	var camera2D = main.get_node("Camera2D")
	var fullPathName = "/root/" + main.name + "/" + camera2D.name
	#print(fullPathName)  # To check.  This will give you something like:  /root/Level_01/Camera2D, etc
	set_remote_node (fullPathName)
No doubt there's probably even easier ways to do this, and someone will be along shortly to point this out.  Anyway, hopefully this helps others out there.

Extremely helpful video series Ben, you explain things well.  Planning to continue on and do your 1-But course in the near future.  Got to strike while the iron is hot. !  +1 LIKE to every video.

@Hons Hon Central "Holy crap it is expensive."
Not at all.  It has 16+ hours of video content, more than 75 lectures, 4 main games sections ...  it's cheap as far as courses go - was $147 but on sale now for $97.  If it wasn't for people like Ben producing free YouTube videos and free and paid courses, then imagine how much harder Godot would be to learn.  You could be trying for hours (or more !) to figure some of the stuff out that he has shown us in short videos.
